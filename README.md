# Jen-Hung (Tom) Chang

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, with a strong focus on **backend systems**, **distributed infrastructure**, and **performance engineering**.

I build software systems that sit close to the hardware and aim to improve efficiency, scalability, and security. From caching remote block devices to designing scalable backend APIs, I enjoy solving problems that require both low-level understanding and high-level design.

## Technical Interests

- Operating systems and file systems
- Distributed systems and cloud architecture
- Backend engineering and API design
- Secure storage and transport protocols
- Caching, concurrency, and performance tuning

## Selected Projects

### Block-Level Persistent Write-Back Cache System  
**C, pthreads, IPsec, BUSE, LRU caching, iSCSI**
- Implements a block-level write-back cache layer for remote storage.
- Optimized for low-bandwidth networks using an LRU eviction heap and asynchronous flush.
- Secure communication via AES-256 IPsec.

### Large-Scale Production Simulation System  
**Java, JavaFX, concurrency, simulation modeling**
- Simulates factory workflows and transport logistics.
- Features a GUI-based dashboard and multithreaded event handling.
- Designed to test discrete-event simulation principles at scale.

### Mini Amazon Backend  
**Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, REST API, Docker**
- Designed a cloud-based backend to handle order workflows.
- Features database-optimized queries, load-balanced request handling, and REST endpoints.
- Uses Docker Compose for microservice deployment.
